# Android GUI Tic-Tac-Toe
This repository contains the code the andrio studio version of Tic Tac Toe. This version is meant to be played on an
andriod app and it is a single player version. The player plays against an AI that attempts to win as well. 

## Strategy for AI 
The AI's move structure is pretty simplistic. 
1. When its the computer's turn it first checks the board to see if it has a chnce of winning and if so it takes that 
move
2. Next when its the computer's turn it checks the board to see if the player has a chance of winning and if so it 
stops the player. 
3. Lastly if the first two conditions cannot be satisfied the computer places a an O randomly on the board.
